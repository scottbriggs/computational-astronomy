## Computational Astronomy

## Benefits of Using R and R Studio

This book will use the R language and the R Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop and test code for computational astronomy. The benefits of using R and R Studio are:

-   R is an environment for data analysis, statistical computing, and graphics - [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org)
-   R is highly extensible, with thousands of packages available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) for specialized functions
-   R Studio Desktop is a free tool from [Posit](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) that allows for the efficient development and testing of R code and documentation.

## DE441 Ephemeris

The data to calculate ephemerides for the planets, sun, and moon come from the DE441 ephemeris [@park2021jpl]. The DE441 ephemeris also includes data for nutation, which is based on a modified nutation model derived from the IAU 1980 theory and the long-term precession model [@vondrak2011new].

## DuckDB Database

A database is used to store DE441 ephemeris data in a standard format instead of reading and parsing each ASCII file as needed. DE441 constants and values, and julian day number data are also stored in the database.
